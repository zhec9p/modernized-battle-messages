# Modernized Battle Messages

## Description
Do you find pressing through "It's super effective!" and other messages of its ilk to be tedious? This plugin replaces some of them with succinct animations to make battles feel snappier and less of a button masher.

## Installation
1. Download `ZVBattleMessages.psdkplug` from the latest version in **[Releases](https://github.com/zhec9p/modernized-battle-messages/releases)**.
2. Place the downloaded file in `YOUR_PROJECT_ROOT/scripts`.
3. Open `YOUR_PROJECT_ROOT/cmd.bat`. This will bring up a command prompt.
4. In the command prompt, type `psdk --util=plugin load` and press Enter,

After installing the plugin, you can open `YOUR_PROJECT_ROOT/Data/configs/plugins/zv_battle_msg_config.json` to see which battle messages are modernized and disable any you wish. `YOUR_PROJECT_ROOT/scripts/00000 Plugins/NNNNN ZVBattleMessages/01 General/001 Config.rb` has comments on what each setting in the JSON file does.

## Limitations
The animations in this plugin are currently meant for 2D battle mode.

## Dependencies
None.
